This Blog gives a brief explanantion on Javascript Objects:
--------------------------------------------------------
Javascript objects is a collection of key and value pair which is used to store various data.anything and everything in a
Javascipt is a object.the javascript objects can be created using flower brackets. the left term is the key and the right
Term are the values of that key.the values can be of any datatypes like str,number etc.

down below objects has been represented in detail:-

let data{
    name:"arjun",
    age:23
}
//this is how a object is created and the "name" and "age" are the Keys and "arjun" and "23" are the values of that keys.

Now let's add some new set of key and value to the object.

data.dob="29/12/2000";
data["is married"]=false;

//Above we have created two new entities for the object and added it now we console log the object data this new data's also
Will be added.
let data{
    name:"arjun",
    age:23,
    dob="29/12/2000",
    age:23
}
//Comma must be used till the last before value.

In objects elements can be accessed and added in two ways:
one is using                     -object name."keyname"="value";
and the other is using Array of  -object["isMarried"]=false;

by this two ways elements can be added and accessed .
the array of method can be used when working on loops for dynamic adding.

Now lets see how to access the elements in a object:
As discussed before elements can be accessed by . and array of methods.

data.name//"arjun"
data.age//23
data["dob"]//"29/12/2000"

So this is how we can access the elements of an object.

Now let's see how to update values in an object.

data.age=30;
data["dob"]="29/12/1993";

Now let's see how to delete a elements in an object.

delete data.age;

Similarly thera are many properties for the object to access or modify the elements.
