Blog on difference Between Document and Window Objects
----------------------------------------------
First let's look into the what is document and window objects:

Window
Window is nothing but the tabs that you see in a brower technically they are called as windows and they are "Global objects". it is the root object of a DOM
Window has many functionalities to do such as "alert,navigation,timerange" and many more.the first thing that is loaded in the browser is the window amd the 
properties releated to that window are stored in the window object.So once a window is loaded and then the document is loadied inside that window.

Document
The object which is loaded inside the window is the document and the properties related to that are stored in the document object.it is the root node of an 
Html document.Some of it's properties are the "addeventlistener,cookie" and many more.we can do DOM manipulation using this.

Now let's see the differnce between Document and Window Object:

	
Document                                                               Window
It is loaded inside the window or browser. 	                          It is the  browser window in which you are seeing the content(which is the document).
It's properties are stored in document object. 	                      It's properties are stored in  window object.
It is loaded after the loading window because the window contains
 a document. 	                                                      It is loaded before the document because window container document.
It is the root element of the document object model. 	              The window is the global element for all objects, functions, etc.
It is an object of window. 	                                          It is an object of the browser.
